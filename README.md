## My Dotfiles

My public dotfiles, inspired by [Coby](https://github.com/cobyism/dotfiles) and [Zach](https://github.com/holman/dotfiles).

## How to use this

```bash
git clone --recursive ben/dotfiles # You're using hub, right?
cd dotfiles
rake
```

It depends on an [Oh-My-Zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh) being installed at `~/.oh-my-zsh`.
